06/10/14	2012 Civic Sedan EX-L Still running great.	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Bought my Civic with 9k mile on it. Was concerned because I had no idea what may have happened with the original owner. Did he unload the car because of problems (I don't trust Carfax)? So now the car has 30k and has been very reliable, fun to drive, and very economical. Just came back from road trip to North Carolina - cruise control most of the way at 50-65 mph (I know, very slow, I wasn't in a hurry to get anywhere) gave me 44 mpg. Usually I get 37+ while driving at speeds 70+ mph and no cruise control use. Car had a little rattle coming from the rear that was eliminated under warranty (seat belt mechanism was the source). Otherwise, not a problem whatsoever (knock on wood).
03/03/14	Honda Fan	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	This is my sixth Honda in 30 years. I researched what I wanted very carefully and decided on the smaller fuel efficient Civic for commuting back and forth to work. With gasoline prices continuing to inch up, this is the best model available without having to go to a hybrid. I have put 1,200 miles on my car,so far and am happy to say I am getting an average of 42 mpg on a tank of gas. I am very happy with my purchase and after shopping at every dealership in the Inland Empire, I was glad to finally find a reputable dealership in Pasadena who did not try to play games or sell me something I didn't want.
01/07/14	Great Car	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I've owned my 2012 Honda Civic for approximately 7 months now and I love it. I get around 27mpg and anywhere from 35-42 on the freeway. Like most people have said, you know what you're buying with a civic. It doesn't have the flash of a Mercedes or the quiet road noise of a Cadillac but this car is definitely worth every dollar. I'm 6'2" 240lbs and the vehicle fits me comfortably. I traded in my 2010 Accord for this vehicle and barely notice the interior size different. Bottom line, I would recommend this car to anyone.
08/27/13	No odometer	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I purchased my 2012 Civic LX in July 2012. It now has about 19,000 miles on it. It does well on gas but I think the fuel guage is inaccurate. It supposedly has a 13 gallon tank yet even when I'm on E and the range says 9 miles I am never able to put more than 10 gallons in it. And then today I left work and noticed I had no odometer display, no maintenance minder info, no fuel mpg info or range info. It just disappeared from the menu. So now I have no way of knowing what my mileage is or when to change my oil. This is my first Honda after driving Hyundai Elantras for 15 years. I should have stuck with Hyundai. Better car for less money.
07/13/13	Things I didn't think about FIRST	2012 Honda Civic DX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	I've had 96 Civic & 98Accord. Bought 2012 Civic 4 door stick shift in May 2011. I've always loved stick for the pickup & gas mileage. Big problems with this car. 1) NO pickup at all. It's embarrassing at a light with even slight incline & people are on your butt & go around u because it takes forever to get up to speed. If AC is on forget it, u have to turn it off until u get to speed. 2) Visibility sucks. There is a thick separator where side mirrors are making window 2 sections creating major blind spots 3) My kids can't have back window down, it causes this vibrating wind sound that hurts your ears. So, things I never thought about have made me unhappy with this car & I'm trading it in
06/24/13	Don't buy a hybrid, get this car!	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Driving from Cincinnati, OH to Gatlinburg, TN this past weekend we averaged 41 MPG while having the sunroof open fully and all the windows open about 2 inches. From there we continued through the App. Mountains to Greenville, SC and averaged 43 MPG with the AC running and we were not doing anything crazy like turning off the motor. I remember the sticker saying this car was rated at 39. We averaged about 73 MPH the whole way in mild to medium traffic. We bought this car with 9000 miles on it for $17,000 and have added 16,000 miles in 6 Months. No expensive or dangerous batteries to mess with and we can turn the ECON button off whenever we want to get more juice.
05/14/13	Overall, a happy owner...minus a few complaints.	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	We purchased our 2012 Civic LX Sedan in Dec. 2011 as a commuter car and have put about 17K miles on it. Like most have mentioned, the road noise is present and the sound system is not up to par. My biggest complaint is the shifter/transmission (auto) tends to vibrate while accelerating quickly. Pulling out in traffic can be a bit dangerous too, if you forget the ECON button is on. That being said, overall, my wife and I are very satisfied with our Civic. The legroom is plentiful for this size car. The fuel economy is great (~32 in City). And the displays are very easily read.
02/10/13	So far so good	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	Been driving a Civic for years. This is my third consecutive new Civic. Previous models were the 98 and 05. Unfortunately this model has impressed me less than the 05. I am 5 foot 11 and often hit my head getting out of the car. They seem to have decreased the cavity opening by 1-2 inches. The carpeting is not really carpet - more akin to a dish scrub brush. This was easily fixed by adding the rubber mats with the protection package. The dash is one huge mass of not so pretty plastic. The plastic on the prior models at least resembled the texture of leather. I find visibility reduced with the long window frame pillars. The good points help reduce the negatives however.
12/12/12	It speaks for itself	2012 Honda Civic DX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Honda's have always been known for their reliability, when you take care of it, it will take care of you... I love my Honda! This car has a great looking interior and exterior regardless of other opinions, people are just snobby! The gas milage is amazing, and the eco option makes it even better. The trunk is not small, unless those who are complaining want to fit a few bodies into it, lol. Everything about this car is wonderful. I would suggest it to anyone looking for a reliable car!
12/04/12	2012 Honda Civic	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Originally purchased a 2000 Civic and have just recently passed it on to my daughter who was only six when I first bought the car. I loved my first Civic and didn't hesitate when buying a new one. Have had it for only a few weeks now, but it's been GREAT! I drive 70 miles per day round trip to and from work and it drives like a dream. I do a lot of highway and city driving and the gas mileage has been excellent. I don't understand the negative reviews. I've had no issue with noise or rattling. It's been a pleasure to drive so far! Hope this one lasts as long as my last!
12/01/12	2012 Honda Civic Sedan - almost love it	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I'm impressed with the styling of my new car. It rides well and is pretty quiet on the road. The gas mileage has been excellent and will get better once I get more than a few thousand miles on it. Buy the side moulding and put it on yourself... because The only issue I have with the car is the extremely thin metal. Don't lean on the front fenders or close the trunk or hood too hard you will easily move, dent or crease the paper thin metal. Interior uses too much hard plastic and the carpet is really better suited for a a scouring pad. For an MSRP of $21,900 Civic DX, Honda seemed to have gotten the message to do better in 2013
11/27/12	Perfect commuter car	2012 Honda Civic DX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	PROS: Nice and sleek look, feeling of a full control of the car. It's nice to take sharper turns. Inside plenty of room not only or the front seats but for the back 3 passengers. Great gas mileage - makes up to 40 mpg even in congested traffic conditions. I have had it for 2 months already and very happy with the purchase. CONS: Compared to my prior car 2006 Elantra it is a little more bumpier and you can really feel every hole on the road and bumps on parking lots have to be taken at under 4mph.
11/26/12	Great car	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	As soon as I test drove this car I knew this was the one I wanted. Honda has a great reputation for being reliable and great quality. It had every feature i was looking for. Handles great and could not beat it for the price. GREAT VALUE.
10/05/12	Brandon Honda -- great dealership - Civic sedan great car	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	We purchased a 2012 Honda Civic Sedan and we are very happy with it. The folks at Brandon Honda in Brandon, Florida were great. Our salesman was Tony M.....he was a jewel. Totally wonderful experience. If you are in the area and want a great buying experience, call Tony at Brandon Honda
10/04/12	exl w nav coupe	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have had the exl nav coupe now for 6 weeks and about 1500 miles mostly city and averaged about 30 to 33 mpg. traded a 2010 coupe for this one. This car is quiter, more comfortable, and has more mid range torgue than the previous one. The leather is top notch and seats are great. The electronics from nav to i mid screen are easy to use and radio functions displayed are really nice. This car feels very luxurious. Its sporty, looks good, has cool electronic dash with lots of color and looks very upscale and space age. This was a good choice and i am very happy with this car.
08/17/12	this econ model is built for MPG	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	All highway at 65 with a/c on = 42+mpg if you leave your foot off the gas and dont drive in a real hilly area. I love it. What value! Econ is fantastic for chinging shift points but you will slow down a bit on a hill - until yuo punch it or take off econ setting. I have seen 46 mpg at lower speeds on flat terrain in the summer and not using the gas pedal much. I got the "dumb" lease $189/mo. Dumb if you dont get one... for business travel. Also have a pilot and an accord - two other no brainers. Fantastic vehicles. get one!
08/07/12	Great car...fun to drive!	2012 Honda Civic HF 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just put 3,000 miles on my 2012 Honda Civic HF and I must say, this car is a joy to drive and it's super easy to park. Visibility is wonderful. There is plenty of legroom/headroom even when my 6'3" son is sitting in the passenger seat. Everything in the car fits just right (I'm 5'9" weight 225 lbs). I use math to figure out the gas mileage (miles driven divided by gallons) and I'm getting 39.573 mpg on average with my first 3,000 miles. I drive 80% hwy, 20% city. I could not be more pleased. This is a conservative car (the styling) for conservative people who want to get from point A to point B without problems. I am very happy with my purchase!!
08/06/12	Confortable Ride but dull engine	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I've been looking at a compact sedan to replace my Mazda 3 hatchback. My list is down to Hyundai Elantra and Honda Civic Sedan EX. I test drove a Civic today and the engine is very dull, no fun at all particularly for someone used to the peppy Mazda3 160 hp.
07/25/12	From 2010 Mazda CX-7 to 2012 Civic EX-L	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	My Mazda CX-7 had to go. It was requiring Premium fuel and only got on average 17mpg. I looked at a couple of other sedans, but I knew the Honda would be the best decision for me because of resale value and reliability. I got the Honda Civic Sedan EX-L and love it more and more every time that I drive it. The leather seats are extremely comfortable. The options available on the MID screen are incredible (set how you want your doors to auto-lock, set Trip A to reset when you fill up fuel, etc.). It took only $37 to fill up the tank the other day (it would have been $60 in the Mazda), I knew that I had made the right decision.
07/04/12	Best in Class!	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I test drove a hyundai elantra, a corolla and corolla S before I drove the Honda. Didn't bother with Ford, Nissan or Kia because I wanted a car that would last for a long time without a doubt. The Hyundai drove well and had a lot of extras but based of past performance and current reviews I felt like they were trying to sell you with extras versus a solid performer. So it came down to the corolla and civic. The civic drove better, had a more attractive and functional interior and I felt Honda put a lot of effort into the design of the civic while it seemed Toyota hasn't done anything to improve the Corolla since 1985. It reminded me of the Tercel my mom had when I was 10 years old.
06/13/12	Good Car With Some Notable Exceptions	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I've driven Hondas for a long time now, so had high expectations with my Civic EX sedan. Unfortunately, I find the new Civic pretty underwhelming, based primarily on two factors: 1) Road noise, caused by a cardboard-thin floorboard. It's not wind noise but rather noise coming up from underneath; loudest sedan I've ever driven in that respect. 2) I'm 6'5", and had no problem with comfort on the test drive. But after several weeks I still cannot find a comfort zone with the seat (headroom is fine). That could easily be solved by an electronic seat, which the Civic EX (like the Accord) should offer. There are lots of things I really like, but if I had to do it all over, I'd get another car.
06/12/12	Great purchase	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I am very happy that I purchased this EXL Civic. I'm enjoying the leather seats, moon roof, navigation, etc. The car is delightful to drive in the city and on the highway and it has more than enough pep for my needs (particularly when econ mode is off, but I usually keep it on to enhance fuel economy). I love the i-mid screen - it's convenient to glance at the upper-level screen while driving. The tech is user-friendly and the voice commands are effective and quite intuitive.
06/09/12	A great little car!	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	This is our 4th Honda (previously had an Accord, CR-V, and Pilot). We bought this EX-L to use mainly as a commuter car for me. We've had it about 2 months now, and I've already got just over 3K miles on it. Gas mileage has been great, it's comfortable, and wind noise is minimal. I know it's considered a "compact" car, but it feels anything but compact. In fact, it feels about the same size as our '90 Accord! Overall, we're very pleased with our purchase.
06/08/12	New 2012! Fun! Fun! Fun!	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I purchased this car new because it felt like a qaulity product from Honda. The MPG is Fantastic. The instant display bar with MPG makes driving the car a fun "game" to maximize your mileage per gallon. Driving in mostly stop and go traffic I am averaging over 33 miles per gallon! It takes a very light foot but the instant display gives you the feed back to learn to drive with a very light foot on the gas peddle. Well done Honda!
06/02/12	20.000 miles in 11 months	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	Still going strong and no issue's,would be bad just after 20k. See the car much more on the road then when it came out. I think people want a relaible commuter and cheap on gas. I'ts only a shame that in a few months a redesigned one comes out........hope this time they do it right and give it six gears with an overdrive.But this one has to make at least 100.000 miles before i even think of something else,and that will be no problem for this car.......
05/14/12	Reliable, 40MPG, Need any more reasons?	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	I bought the Honda Civic LX last June and have put on this car about 15,000 miles. I'm not sure why this car initially got so many bad reviews. From what I can tell and have experienced these people reviewed the wrong car or are on drugs. Here are the facts after owning this car for almost 1 year. It averages about 39.8 mpg for my 30 mile commute to and from work everyday, is a blast to drive and I have had no mechanical or electrical problems at all. If you are looking for a great car, low maintenance, high mpg then look no further. I walked out of the dealership paying $18,000 for this car and have since then payed it off. I will keep this car as long as possible. Thank you Honda!
05/10/12	A five star vehicle	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have a new Honda Civic EX for about two months now and its been a great car. Very happy with the way its drive and no blind spots , very easy to see out all around the car while driving it. Its very comfortable to drive and great seats. Its really good on gas and I have been getting 31 to 33 mpg in the city and its all mostly city driving with some stops. Can't wait to see what its gets on the highway. I got a silver one and I really like the color silver because its does'nt show very much dirt and its a nice color. Overall its a very nice car that why I rate it five star.
04/16/12	Driving the new 2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr sedan	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just bought a new 2012 Civic LX from Norm Reeves Honda in Cerritos, California. [non-permissible content removed] Now about my new car. It is so good looking, and it is so wonderful to drive. I researched many vehicles through Consumer Reports and Edmunds and also Kelly Blue Book, and I wasn't quite sure. However, I am in love with how it drives. It is so right for me. I wanted fun, and I got fun. I wanted economy, and I got economy. I wanted a great looking vehicle, and I got that too.
04/08/12	Honda is still the best!!!	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	So far so good. I'm glad I bought this Civic EX-L at an excellent deal over $1k below Edmund's. It is used as an additional car for the wife's shopping, school, church and around town errands. Our Montero 20th Anniv is good for outdoors and long drives but at 14/18mpg :-( Love our Honda.. It's been getting at least 35-38mpg. Too bad the reviews did not get them any fair shot.
04/06/12	2012 Civic EX-L Nice	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The beautiful Civic Honda is an excellent all around car. The seats are a little uncomfortable, but other than that it is excellent quality. The edge of the seats seem firm and cause discomfort on a long journey. But the handling is excellent.
04/05/12	vibration issue solved	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	I almost traded in my brand new 2012 honda civic sedan lx with manual trans! I was getting a disturbing vibration when I accelerated to about 50 mph. The whole car vibrated like I was driving over a grooved highway, and then I thought that perhaps I blew a tire or something. It was intermittent. The Service Tech discovered that when you have only the rear windows down halfway the vibration happens and sounds like a helicopter! An aerodynamic thing. I wanted to let people know this just in case they are experiencing the same issue! Now that I know it is nothing serious I am back to LOVING MY NEW CIVIC!!! Getting 30 mpg with mixed around town and highway driving! Great car!!!
03/27/12	another great Civic	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	first off, we have been driving Honda/Acura products since 1984. The wife has had 06 and an 09 Accord EX-L and was ready for something new. Her car is usually driven on our trips, long and short, and the Accords were great but with the 2 of us in it most of the time, the Civic seemed like the logical choice when looking for a new car. It is perfect for what we drive it for and the gas savings is incredible so far, compared to the Accords.
03/03/12	Fun little car	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I bought my Civic back in Sept. I like howit rides, handles, and is quiet too. I would agree that there is a lot of hard plastic surfaces and blank switchplates, but they are built right.Seats are comfortable and have lots of room inside too.
03/03/12	Love My Civic EX	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I purchased my 2012 Civic EX last May, and I love it! It is a zippy ride, and I get compliments on the appearance of the car all the time. I had a "08 Civic and loved it too, but the new technology in the new Civics is great. Drive one....you will like it and the reliability and resale are awesome. You can't go wrong with a Civic!
03/01/12	You are not buying a Mercedes	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	So I have had my Civic for one week. Traded a 2005 Altima SL LOADED. I have a base LX automatic. I bought this solely for the gas mileage and in that respect I am getting much more than I expected. This is not a luxury car so don't buy it if that is what you are looking for. The drive is nice and tight, shifting is smooth, braking is decent. It is stylish and solid. I have about 250 miles on it and I have averaged about 36 mpg with 80% hwy and 20% city driving. This is my first Honda and so far I am extremely impressed. I was able to buy it for a touch less than invoice which made it very reasonably priced. I highly recommend this car if you are looking to save gas money.
02/15/12	Civic quality getting worse	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	I just bought an LX manual, and ... basically I m kind of dissatisfied.I traded in an LX 2000 manual that lasted me 12 years which I think had better interior fit/finish and less road noise. I don't see this car lasting that long. When above 60mph the road noise is really unacceptable. No carpet on the inside but a weird flimsy material that looks like what they put under the mattress box to cover the springs. The 2 level dashboard is BS. Must have been designed by a drunk engineer because the speedometer is perfectly covered by the steering wheel. why didI get it?looks good,handles well, good mpg,i-pod hookup. Like the climate control that stay the way you put them and don't reset
01/31/12	So Happy I Didn't Listen to the Reviews	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I bought my last Civic used--I was the 4th owner....she was a 2004 EX Coupe. Due to mechanical issues I was forced to trade her off about 2 years before I wanted to. I had read the reviews on the 2012 Civic and I was leary...so I test drove three Toyotas, a Subaru, two Mazdas a Ford and a CR-V, Accord and a Fit. Still undecided, I decided to drive a Civic. Thank goodness I make my own decisions and don't listen to everyone else..... I knew before I hit the interstate I was going to buy it. It is somewhat noisy--but nothing like my 2004. The ride is way smoother and it's a fun car to maneuver through town. I have no regrets at all--very happy with my purchase. This is my 6th Honda.
01/29/12	Fun and good car, but has its flaws...	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just bought the 2012 Civic sedan in October, so I've had the car for 3, almost 4, months now. I was in LOVE with the previous Civic models, particularly the coupe. My friend drives the black '09 coupe and I wanted something along those lines. I test drove a gorgeous blue one which was probably 2009 as well and really liked it. However, my mom wanted to get me a brand new car and all the older ones were used, so we settled for this one. Really not much to complain about, except for the cheap plasticky interior and the loud wind/road noise. Ugh! Other than that, beautiful and colorful graphics/dashboard and a reliable car. Great w/ gas too! Got plenty of compliments on it.
01/29/12	Poorly Designed Lots of Rattles and Buzzes	2012 Honda Civic HF 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just bought a 2012 Civic and I can't enjoy it because there is a vibrating/rattling sound coming from the dash and it is driving me crazy. I took it in and the service department said there was no noise. Huh? My mechanic and I went for a ride and he said Honda is nuts and there is a problem with the assembly with loose screws and vibrating cables behind the dash. I wish I could enjoy it but I really can't. I am going to get rid of it and get a Toyota. I'll loose a lot of money but i can't stand that noise. I drove from Chicago to Grand Rapids and had terrible neck and should pain afterwards. I could deal with it if it weren't for that stupid noise.
01/11/12	Smart Purchase	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have been looking for a while to a secondary car for our family that will be used mainly in town. I have test driven Corolla, Mazda 3, Elantra, Sentra, and Focus. I could not fall in love with any of them either due to comfort level, suspension issues, reliability, or re-sale value. Our primary car has always been Honda (our latest is a 2012 Accord LX) and my husband suggested that I consider the 2012 Civic. Though I drove a Civic few years ago, I was hesitant because of all the talks in the media about the new geneneration of the Civic. However, as I had nothing to lose, I went ahead and actually test drove the car both in town and on highway for 20 miles and was pleasantly surpised.
12/19/11	excellent car	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	My wife and I purchased our EX sedan 4.5 months ago and we currently have 8500 mile on it. We both love the car. It drives well, it is quieter than our previous Hondas, and the fuel economy is excellent. It is true that the interior has suffered from cost-cutting such as the dashboard, carpet, and roof liner. However, I really don't touch the roof liner, our all season floor mats cover up the carpet, and even though the dashboard is all hard plastic it still looks o.k. to me. The stereo sounds pretty good and the bluetooth phone connection is great. I am very impressed with all the safety equipment that it has and the fact that it has great crash test results.
12/14/11	40 miles on my new car and it's in the SHOP THIS IS RIDICULOUS PLEASE READ	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	My 2012 Honda Civic had 43miles on it when the Check Emissions light came on. I was near the dealer and took it straight in. He said you have to leave it here. I had groceries in the trunk and had to go home only to bring it back and told I could get it that night. Only to get a call saying it's not going to be ready until Wednesday only to get a call on Wed saying the car won't be available till Friday if that because they had to order a part thru Honda Factory that was coming from Kentucky. Only to get find out I am asked to be a "Guinea pig" for Honda to put a "black box" in my car to track my car for two weeks to see if this is going to be a deal they need to bulletin.
12/12/11	I Love My little Civic	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	To tell you the trusth i hated the last civic. So when the dealership initially showed me this Civic i was thinking in my head, "Im going to hate this, this is a waste of my time", till i actually looked at the car and drove it. My wife also didnt like it till she sat in it, and she fell in love with it after driving it. I had also takin the Nissan Versa out for a drive and when i got in it it was huge! But after 20 mins of sitting in it I absolutly hated it. So we ended up getting the civic for $1k more. The technology in this car is absolutly amazing. Its 3 times what the versa will EVER be.
12/11/11	loving this car	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I gave up my aging 2000 accord ex-v6 for the '12 civic and have no regrets. Originally my goal was to get a Honda fit which handled nicely and had good utility space but when I sat in a Civic, it was a whole different story. The drivers seat felt great(fit's seat felt stiff) and my eyes were drawn to the dashboard. Immediately I was impressed. I test drove it twice at 2 different dealers and fell in love with it and knew i had to go home with it that day. The gas milage is excellent and when I'm sitting in it I don't feel cramped at all. I will be enjoying this car for a very long time.
12/07/11	2012 Honda Civic EX Best Buy!	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just got a new Honda Civic EX from Bergstrom in Oshkosh, WI. They called me, suggested I come in and trade my 07 Honda Fit. I went in, and test drove the Civic. I really noticed a couple of things immediately..the dash reminded me of the wonderful Mercury Cougar I had in 1990, and the ride was very similar...Quiet! The dash features looked complicated, but the menu took me through it all, and was not any harder than programming my cell phone. Speaking of cell phone, the Blue Tooth hookup in the Civic not only worked first time, but every time I enter the car, it automatically hooks up. I tested it with my wife in the car, watching the dash, and it mated when I was 40 feet away. BUY IT
11/21/11	My New Civic EX	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Just got it! Fresh out of the box with 12 miles on it. I am replacing the wife's 2000 Accord that she totaled last week. I am a Honda guy and a Michelin man. It is a beautiful car, and has everything we need except for XM, though we can stream it through BT audio from our Droids. Continental tires suck, but just put Michelin Primacy's on it at 101 miles. Crazy expenditure?! Not for my wife! Result: Like night and day! I am all Honda and am pissed about CR reviews, but bucked the trend. This IS a Honda. The iMid is fun, stereo sounds decent, seats (cloth) are excellent. Paint is beautiful. Not fast, but trying to keep up with the Prius's, no batteries! Scrap Conti tires you will will enjoy!
11/21/11	2012 Civic	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I went from a chevy truck to a Civic in May and I am very pleased. I test drove the 2011 and 2012 civic. The 2012 has more room for the driver because the E-brake is back further for more room. I am 76 inches tall at 265lb and comfortable in this vehicle. It also is iPod ready and very friendly to operate all features. The ECON feature is unbelievable to say the least. Gas mileage has increased since I bought this car. I now have 7500 miles on it and my MPG was 45 average on my drive home from work, it was 33MPG before I filled up due to my in town driving. You can't ask for a better car and gas mileage on a gas engine. It is peppy, but the more you get into it the lower the MPG.
11/19/11	Still a great ride!	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	My intitial impression of owning the car is great. It's incrementally better than gen. 8 (2006-2011) The information display is very helpful and the ride is comfortable. Continental 16" tires have been no problem in rain on the hwy and car handles in typical Honda fasion with a compliant and solid feeling. The interior, which has been the subject of much debate could feel a little "warmer" but overall isnt offensive. The navigation system in my vehicle helps to absorb some of the plainess on the dash associated with lower trim models. I continue to stay with Honda for their reliablity, strong resale value and for how well im treated at my local Honda dealership for service.
11/08/11	Best in Class	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I needed a reliable commuter car. I looked at the Mazda 3, Hyundai Elantra, VW Jetta and Mazda 6. The Civic's handling is just as good as the Mazda 3 and the LX has way better standard features. I've driven almost 1000 miles and have very few complaints. I drive about 60 miles a day (mixed) and with the 'Econ' feature off I get about 36 mpg, when it's on I get about 38mpg. The handling and build quality of the car are outstanding. The seats could be more comfortable and the standard speakers have muddy mids and highs, but good bass. I paid almost $1000 less than INVOICE so that was a huge factor in me getting the Civic. I have no complaints about road noise but the engine can get loud.
11/02/11	Civic - better than ever!	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	We bought the car a few months back with overall value in mind. Overall value, for our purposes, was defined as a combination of reliability, gas mileage, safety, long term cost of ownership, and comfort. I would say in that order -- but really all of them were high on the order list. We were not looking for the type of car to modify or look thuggish, and we did not want the type of car that gets stolen for that purpose like some of the older Japanese models like Civics did. As a VALUE oriented car, this vehicle is spectacular and exactly what we wanted. We have stopped subscribing to CR as their quality of reviews over the last couple of years has gone more the way of sensationalism
10/28/11	update 9000 miles	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	Have 8 k on it now with the manual and till now it is ok ,but not more than that.If you want the "old" feeling of driving fun you better stay with a 8th generation civic.......... It's a commuter from a to b and relaible. Got some engine noise after 2000 miles,must come from the valves,a ticking noise,not used to it,my 2009 lx had 30k on it and still sounded new. See how this works out in awhile,will ask about it with the first service interval.Mpg is still great without the econ button 45 mpg...... Never use the econ button anymore,spoils the power and not that much different in mpg...
10/15/11	Wonderful Little Car	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	... just bought the EXL and could not be more pleased. I was able to get car $1000 below Edmunds. Before you decide on another small car just go and drive this one. I think that you will be pleased. As far as noise, I traded in a 2003 Grand Marquis with 38,000 miles on this car and there is no more noise than the Mercury. Driving is believing.
10/10/11	Happy Cowboy	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I'm a recreational shooter, and I do alot of highway driving on the weekends to participate in various shooting events. For many years I've made these trips in 4X4 trucks and have wasted alot of gas in the process. I wanted a vehicle that gets great mpg, would effectively haul myself and my equipment, and has the comforts of A/C, cruise, auto, CD, power locks and windows. I also wanted to buy from a manufacturer with a lengendary rep for longevity and reliability. The Civic LX sedan fits my needs wonderfully. My trips regularly take me over the high mountain passes of Colorado, and even with the automatic transmission the civic has no problem doing the speed limit over the hills.
10/09/11	Disappointed,	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I purchased Civic LX (1.8L 4-cyl Automatic) in August 2011.The first impression was the car looked sharp and the price was reasonable. However, after driving it for about 2,500 miles, the biggest problem is excessive road noise. I drove Toyota, Ford and Nissan before but I never had such a noisy car. The mpg is 35 to 38 which I expected but I didn't expected such a excessive road noise.
09/28/11	Great commuting car	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I purchased this car in July. I have been using this car since then. I am having 2500 miles on it. Car's interior and exterior design is great. So I like driving this car. Before I was using 99 Nissan Altima. My new civic is 30 % economical then previous car. I usually commute to work using my new civic. In city and highway (mix) I usually get 34.4 mpg. It's perfect car for commuting to work
09/16/11	Honest	2012 Honda Civic HF 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The exterior of this vehicle is very nice, a drastic improvement over the last model. The interior leaves something to be wanted. It really doesn't do anything for me. The ride is nice, and the fuel efficiency is great for a gas engine. I averaged around 42 mpg on the interstate. The greatest grip I have is the "eco-boost" of the HF model, and the transmission of all. I think some work needs to be done in both areas. The automatic transmission acts more like a manual due to poor downshifting, and make sure to be a complete stop before changing into Drive, even if you are rolling forward. Overall, its a Honda, so I expect to have it well past 300K miles.
09/07/11	Baby Blue 2012	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	My new 2012 Civic replaces a beloved 1995 Camry and it immediately felt as comfortable and solid as the Camry. It handles well, is easy to drive, and gets 32 mpg in the city. On a recent road trip, we fit in three adults with luggage, camping gear, and extras. We got 38 mpg on the trip, and it was quiet enough to easily have conversations with our back seat passenger.
08/09/11	Great Car!	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Just purchased the car today, first of great car and all the reviews from those other guys are wrong, I did not hear any excessive wind noise. Interior is great! The two tier dash worked for Honda and the color changes and the I-Mid, really stand out for the "wow" factor for me. Rides great, so far fuel economy is wonderful. The slanted hood will take some getting used to, my previous car was a 96 Acura, so the hood was long and could judge your distance better.
08/03/11	Best value for money plus gr8 ride&handling	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	We have been honda customers for a while..own a 99 accord (has crossed 225000 miles) which stills runs nicely and gives 35mileage..had leased 2007 accord which we loved. I recently bought 2012 civic and I love it. Moving from accord to civic may seem like a downgrade, but the priorities have changed, mileage and monthly cost being the top. The other option we considered was prius..But $7-8K additional price gives me -ve NPV over 5years..also I got 0.9 APR from honda financial My new civic gives me avg 42+mileage (I am mostly on freeway)..comfortable and spacious seats (for my 6'1" hubby too)..smooth ride&handling..
08/01/11	2012 Civic EX 4door	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Disappointed to hear CR wrote a poor review. I had an 06 same model, sold to grandson, bought 2012. Not a lot of difference. The dash display encourages thrifty driving; ECON setting really works. Good handling, etc., but perhaps it just "stayed the same" in many respects while competition improved. Get 40+ on highway, 30 in city. Seems quiet enough. Have to program door locks, sort of annoying the way they work. Hard to program radio. Recommend the car. Seems a bit roomier for the driver, seatls are better than '06.
07/24/11	Great Buy!	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I was in the market for an econo car and Edmund's site was a big help. Narrowed down my selection to Jetta TDI, Elantra and Civic. At the end of the day, went with Civic and can't be more pleased. The car is VERY comfortable even for 6ft+ individuals. I can't get over how well this thing rides. I've owned a TL & MDX in the past and this car is a pleasure to drive! Fuel economy is also great. I'm averaging 35+mpg to the tank on mixed driving. I do spend a lot of time in traffic during my daily commute. If you're look'n for a great econo car that drives well, is reliable you will not go wrong with selecting this car. It's not flashy but gets the job done.
07/21/11	Great Value	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Hard to beat these things for value. Traded in a 2009 civic exl with 30,000 only because I have to be the first to buy anything updated. Cost me 4500 or 1500 per year. Lota nice new in electronics, softer handling and little less road noise. Downside......no standard xm in exl and the cupholders redesigned for cups that I don't have nor have yet found in stores. The center consel in my 09 was deep and big, this one is small and shallow. storage sleeves on doors have also been downsized. Have 1700 miles and at 32.9 mixed. I drive aggressively and seldom engage econ, also live in hilly area of western Pa. Aside from the storage issues love the car and would buy again.
07/19/11	Best valued compact	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	This is the second Civic that I've owned. The first was a 1980 (new) hatchback. These two cars have absolutely nothing in common. On my list was the new Elantra, corolla, Jetta, SX4 sedan and the Mazda 3. I felt that after studing, selecting and judging value, the Civic came out on top. This car drives exceptionally well for a car in it's class. I rented an Elantra for 24hrs and was not pleased with the comfort or the ride whatsoever. Not as powerful as the Mazda but again, you can't beat the road manners of the Civic., a real pleasure to drive, in my opinion.
07/03/11	It's The Best In It's Class	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have had my 2012 Civic EX-L W/Navigation for about a week now. I have never owned a Honda before and for my 65th birthday I decided to get me a new Civic. My criteria for a new car was fuel economy, performance and resale value. The cars I considered were Elantra, Focus, Cruze and Civic. I read volumes of reviews and came to the conclusion that the so called expert reviewers felt the 2012 Civic did not make much of a change to the previous years and therefore they felt that Honda had taken a step back to the other models I was considering since they had surpassed the Civic in styling. Since styling was not one of my criteria points those reviews did not stray me away from considering a Civic. In fact since I never have owned a Honda I thought the styling was perfect for best fuel economy. Without going into all of the reasons I decided to buy the Civic (Elantra comes without a spare tire) I will give you my impressions of the first week of owning one. The Civic is very roomy and comfortable. I do wish the glove box and center console were a little bigger, but I can live with the size they are. The I-Mid and navigation screen give you more data than you could imagine. Some reviewers call it cheesy. I think it's pretty cool and very informative. Civics come with an "ECON" button that optimizes your fuel economy. When your ECON button is activated your performance takes a hit and acceleration is not as good as it would be with the ECON button not in use. Some reviewers say they can't see any difference between having the ECON button on or off. Well, I'm here to tell you there is a difference and it's noticeable. But, if you are trying to get the best possible fuel economy that you can then using the ECON button will save you fuel. On my first tank of gas I used the ECON as much as possible in city and highway and got a combined 34.3 mpg. In that first tank I drove from Sacramento to Reno and got 37.5 mpg ( lot of driving uphill and ECON was off while climbing those hills) Coming home from Reno I got 45.5 mpg ( lot of going downhill and had ECON on) So far I am very pleased with fuel economy. The Civic handles well in the turns and with the ECON off it has plenty of pep as far as I'm cornered. The air conditioning works great and cools off the cabin nicely. Those in the back seat were very comfortable in 97 degree weather. I do see me tinting the back windows though. The Bluetooth was easy to sync up with my Droid and call quality is very good. I'm impressed with the sound system and love being able to use a USB drive. I still have much to learn about this car but so far it is everything I was hoping it would be. I got the EX-L W/Navi for $22,500. I added some other accessories and of course tax, license and doc fees. I also got an 8 year 100,000 extended warranty for $1,200. If you decide to get yourself a 2012 Civic you will not be disappointed. You may not have the sexiest looking car on the road but you will have a solid car that you can depend on now and in the future.
06/29/11	Traded my 2008 Accord for the 2012 Civic	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The MPG is what they claim on the sticker but you have to have the econ mode on in order to achieve 30 in the city and about 40.5-41 on the highway. I have not tried to drive the Civic on the Off mode of the econ because I do live in Chicago and the gas pricesÂ, well you can fill in the blank. So if you are looking for a gas savior and do not want a hybrid then get the 2012 Civic without a question. I do have a word of cautionÂif you are driving on the econ mode and you are on the highway, do Not expect acceleration or getting in front of a Camaro. The good thing about the econ mode is you can turn it off whenever you want to including when youÂre driving.
06/29/11	Stayed with the Civic	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	No other car in this market comes to the real 40 mpg,but with honda it's easy for me,did it already with an 1992,1998,2001,2009 and now the 2012. Finally it has some comfort,noise level in the cabine is acceptable. Have the 5 speed manual and it's the same transmission used for the 2001-2005 civic. At 65mph it makes 2700 rpm's,in the automatic it's 2200 rpm's,but this time you don't here it and still you get your 40 mpg,also because of the Econ button in the 5 speed.makes 2-3mpg on a tank of gas.Like to shift again because the automatic is not my thing.That shifting up and down the gears when i don't like it to shift! Everything under control again and i like it!
06/27/11	Best of current alternatives	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	If you are looking for a state of the art vehicle for the early 21st century, this is the best of all current alternatives. Reasonably comfortable, roomy and well designed, with excellent engineering and attractive interiors, it is difficult to argue that any other 4 door sedan would be superior. Even though a 2012 model, dealer provided discount, good trade in value and .09% 5 year financing. It is difficult to comprehend the criticism of this vehicle. If you want a sports car, buy a Miata or a Ferrari. If you want comfortable, dependable and reasonably roomy transportation with a good list of features such as bluetooth and a sunroof, AND great fuel efficiency and reliability, buy a Civic.
06/24/11	Best Economy Car Ever!	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I was getting pretty sick of the up and downs in the gas prices and really got concerned when gas approached $4 a gallon. I decided that my 22 MPG Santa Fe had to go. I shopped around and fell in love with the 2012 Civic. I gave up the power of a V6 for the fuel economy of a 4 cylinder and I don't regret it. I cruised from Cleveland to Columbus at got 41 MPG. Take that Big Oil! I don't need my wallet sucked dry every time I fill up. The Focus was interesting but the cockpit was cramped. I did not like that the auto transmission chattered on my initial test drive. The Hyundai Elantra styling was too extreme and the KIA Forte looked cheap on the inside.
06/22/11	2012 Honda Civic, Best yet!!!	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	First a review correction for Edmunds! The new 2012 Honda Civic gets 39 mpg highway!!!! your review stated incorrectly the following: "The front-wheel-drive 2012 Honda Civic is powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that puts out 140 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque. Transmission choices include a five-speed manual and an available five-speed automatic (HF and EX models get the automatic as standard equipment). This combination returns EPA fuel economy estimates ranging from a low of 28 mpg city/36 mpg highway" The additional info on HP and Torque are otherwise correct. Best Civic yet! Highly reccomended.
06/20/11	Amazing little car!	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	We were originally going to get an Accord, but decided to take a good look at the 2012 Civic, because it was redesigned and just seemed to offer a lot for the money. It doesn't disappoint! One of the complaints often heard about the last gen Civic was road noise. They have addressed that with the 2012 model. The overall ride is superb, we thought we would need an Accord before getting this level of quality. It does not feel like an economy car at all!
06/15/11	Love It	2012 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just traded my 2009 CRV for the Civic and so far I am in love with it. It drives like a car larger than it is. So comfortable and the dash is so well laid out. Air conditioning is much colder than my CRV was.
06/13/11	42.5 mpg on first commute!	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I just traded my Infiniti G35 sedan which was a great car. Now that my commute is 112 miles each day, I needed a more economical car. The 2012 Civic EX-L has a luxury feel to it, a great ride, plenty of back seat room, and the seats are comfortable. I got a whopping 42.5 mpg according to the trip computer on my way in. I have read some negative press reviews but don't see the problem with the new conservative look. The interior is quiet, the ride is smooth, and the dash layout is really interesting. I like the new information screen.
06/04/11	Best Car I have ever owned!!	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have owned alot of cars. I have never been as impressed with a car as much as this Civic. it is fuel efficient, built tight, reliable and fun to drive. I had a Nissan before I bought my first Honda. I thought that Nissan is as good as Honda but I was wrong. On my brand new Nissan, I had to replace an Axle, the rubber silicone cover on my driver side window because of a Wind Tab poor design, my fuel pump twice, an exterior trim twice and my Air Bag passanger sensor and then I hear rattling noise, paint chips off. I decided to switch to Honda based on the advice of close friends who owned Honda for years. Yes, It is alittle more expensive but this car will save you alot of money on maintance
05/20/11	Upgrade from '97 DX	2012 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	This is my second Honda Civic. I bought the first one in 96 which is now going to go to my son (he was in kindergarten when I bought it and is now 2nd year University student). I have had the car for only three days. So I cannot attest to its reliability and other long term performance.
05/11/11	2012 Civic Driving Experience	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Since there isn't a lot out there on the 2012 Civic EX-L with Nav. just wanted to share my experience. I traded a 2009 Avalanche for this car. Going from my Avalanche to a Civic took a little bit of physical and emotional adjustment. The avalanche averaged about 18 mpg the civic just under 40. I weigh 250 lbs and don't find the car uncomfortable. Filling up the civic about $35. A big drop from $110. for the Avalanche. The car is peppy if you want to drive it hard but using the eco and trying to stay in the green as much as possible is best for fuel. The near 40 mpg that I managed was some hwy and in town driving. So it's a good estimate for the average driver. I was using the ac all the time
05/08/11	Not too shabby	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Just got my Dyno Blue EX-L Civic about a week ago. Going from my 2009 Nissan Titan Crew Cab was a bit tough, but this is a great little car. The new design is very cool, and the tech gadgets are fun. The MPG is great, and the econ mode makes the car gutless, but it's easy to switch off if you need more zip. If you are looking for a really nice commuter car or a great car for around town...this is it. I have had several Honda's in the past and they are reliable and well built. You can't go wrong with this little guy.
05/05/11	Great Car!	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan w/Nav (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	This is my second Honda Civic. The 2012 Honda Civic EX-L with Navigation System is a great car for all round car for technology buffs like me. Great gas mileage 40+ on the Highway. Good ride that handles bumps with composer. Technology like Bluetooth, XM Satellite Radio, USB connection for Music devices, CD player and a great Navigation System with FM traffic. What else can on ask for?
05/04/11	Nice redesign	2012 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Took delivery of a beautiful blue EX-L last night. Love the redesign. The 5 inch information display is a very nice addition. Performance and fun to drive didn't get high marks. I mean, it's a Civic and my other car is a 335I. But for what I was looking for in a commute car, it fills the bill. Hitting the ECON button does in fact make it noticeably harder to accelerate, but it should be great for best mileage and you can turn it off quickly. Seats not all that comfortable, but my wife thinks they're fine so could just be me.
06/27/14	Gets better...	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have had my 2013 Civic EX Sedan now for over 6 months. I initially had trouble getting comfortable in the seat but now that I have adjusted the horribly forward-tilted headrest and found a seat height and steering wheel adjustment that works for me, I find the car comfortable for my daily commute. Other than that, the car is flawless so far and has that "Honda Feel" behind the wheel that only a Honda can provide in my experience - like its connected to you in someway and always seems to know what you want to do!
06/18/14	Not bad, not great.	2013 Honda Civic LX PZEV 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Overall the car has performed its purpose and I am satisfied. There are a few things I am disappointed with, first being the paint. The car is black on black, and have had it almost 10 months and put on over 20,000 miles. The car looks like it has been through a sandblaster. My old car, a 1998 Honda civic, is in about the same condition but it took 14yrs of wear to get in that condition. Its pretty disappointing to have a car less than a year old look this bad. Second, the mileage is mediocre. Average 31 mpg highway, although I don't ever drive city so I don't know if it would stay the same or get worse. In Hondas defense, the highway speed is usually 75-80mph so that doesn't help.
05/13/14	Not what hoped for from a Honda	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Bought new for daughter. FIRST ONE- Had to pull transmission at 162 miles. Gave me a new one and many small items. Scratch in dash. Dimples on back side of steering wheel, right where you grab the wheel to turn it ( looks like poor molding/manufacturing). Have never had the day(s)where I was like...love the car due to too many items. Wish had cash back.
05/02/14	An Update to my 1st Review	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have a 2013 Honda Civic LX with a little over 10,000 miles on it now. Let me tell you, my average full economy in South Florida heat with use of Eco mode most of the time, is averaging between 30-31 per each tank. If I drive on long highway trips around 65pmg with ECO mode on, it averages around 44mpg, which is excellent! The only thing I don't like about ECO mode is that it is embarassingly slow off the line. While the A/C is slightly effected while in this mode, it doesn't seem weak, even with 89 degrees outside. It's a great car for the money. I wouldn't have done it any other way, just wish I had springed for the EX.
04/23/14	Awesome car, Honda san	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I love my 13 Civic EX Sedan. Alabaster Silver/Black Cloth. Mudguards. Shopping bag hooks. I have been really impressed as have family and friends. I am glad I didn't get the leather seats, which take longer to cool than black cloth, and I love everything about this car. As the satisfied owner of a 5-speed 1989 Civic DX Hatchback, an automatic 03 Corolla CE, and a 2009 Corolla XLE, all I can say is, Wow. 22,000 miles and loving it.
04/03/14	Great car but test out the seat first	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I got my Honda Civic EX about a month ago. The car is amazingly quiet and handles very well around town and out on the highway - very stable at highway speeds. The electronics are very easy to use and have sharp, bright graphics that make them a pleasure to use. The Bluetooth system easily synced with my iPhone 4s. The back up camera is great! The only negative is the driver's seat. I am 6-0, 180 lbs and it was extremely difficult to find a comfortable driving position. The front of the seat cushion puts pressure on my legs and is very uncomfortable. Pay attention to the seat feel when you test drive it.
03/31/14	Love the interior and exterior	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I have never had a Honda Civic. I have and still have a 2004 Honda Accord EX which I gave to my daughter for college. So far I have been totally impressed with this car except for the pick up power. I have noticed the hesidancy in take off especially if you are on I-75 trying to go around a slow driver. Going uphill it loses speed if you are not in cruise control. When I test drove it, wish I had taken it on I-75. I am hoping like the 4 cylinder Camri that I had, this Honda will surprise me when I obtain more mileage on the car and have better pick up. Anyway I love the gas mileage!
03/26/14	so confused	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The Honda product is generally, well, you know, hard to beat, right? I own this car now. I am so very disappointed. If they could remake the 1997 Honda Civic EX 5-speed with the Exact same materials they used back in 1997, that would make me very happy. Keep dreaming, right? I Miss the Old Cruise Control. The 2013 is OK, but the 1997 Cruise Control I liked much better. I Miss the Old Moon Roof on the 1997. This 2013 is not superior at all. The 1997 Moon Roof was superior because I could control the width and the placement of it was absolutely PERFECT. Not so on 2013 model. It's like I don't even have a moon roof, really.....
03/25/14	Love my EXL	2013 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I had a 2007 CRV EX with leather, it had 111,00 miles on it and the extedned warrany was up. My salesmen was in the service department I had ot leave the CRV overnight for a warranty repair. He called me the next day with a great deal and I could not pass it up at all. Its a 2013 Civic EXL brand new it was a left over from the model year.
03/21/14	Good performer but very uncomfortable	2013 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	This is my fourth Civic and it is the most uncomfortable car I've ever owned. The headrest forces he to jut my head forward and the seat to curl my back. When I brake, no matter how gently, I and my passenger slide forward in the seats. I have long legs and the steering wheel will not telescope out far enough so I drive with your arms stretched out. Even though I have the EX-L with the power seat adjustments, I have yet to find a comfortable driving position. The seat is narrow and I am spilling over the side of it even though I am a size 6, I have to tighten my abs to stay in the seat around corners. On the plus side, the car is powerful, the handling is good, the mileage is excellent.
02/15/14	Honda Civic rules!!!!!	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I am not sure why all the negative reviews on the 2013 Civic, I love my new Civic EX!!! I especially love the 2 level speedo because I keep my steering wheel low so the high mount speedo actually works great for me. And to the people that complained about lack of power, quality of interior, etc, SHAME on you for not noticing during your test drive!!!!! The Civic is not a perfect car, but it suits me perfectly!!!
01/03/14	is perfect for me, except for some rattles	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	the car performs excellent. I am hoping for the Honda reliability. So far, gas mileage is excellent. Interior ..... car is easy to navigate (viewing the i-MID system is ..... p e r f e c t .... when compared to others. It is clear, concise and simple. Well done! Bravo! So far, a perfect car except I cannot give five stars on interior design due to the rattling noises I experience in the area of the controls for the CD player, volume button and it really annoys me.
01/01/14	Great car for what it is; however......	2013 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	There are some issues that make this not a 5-star car (for me). I purchased a new Civic EX-L in August 2013 after having driven a Mazda Tribute for 12 years. I admit to it being a huge change and adjustment. I have about 3,500 miles on it as of the date of this review. My main complaint is how it drives in wet/snowy conditions. It seems to have issues gripping the road, and even with just a dusting of snow on the road it spins it's tires when trying to move from a stopped position (no, I don't drive like Mario Andretti.) I have 30+ years experience driving in the snow and do not feel confident in this car's ability to navigate the roads during a midwest winter.
12/06/13	Dear Honda Designers:	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The ride is comfortable. The noise level is reduced tremendously. Rear Windows -don't like feeling like I own a Dodge Avenger. Prefer a temp gauge-not icons. Get rid of split level dash board!! Get rid of digital speed. Prefer Odometer to include *simultaneously* Total Miles Driven & Trip Miles. Poor Sun Visors-Poor quality. Poor Interior vinyl quality-cheap quality. Exterior Paint--Poor Quality. Prefer key hole on Passenger Door & Trunk. Hood construction is odd-- don't care for the leaf trap or sensors. Need a junk trap under the Hand Brake. Need more space on door panels. All of the AC Buttons/AC Unit/Design is a Hazard (to me)
10/07/13	I Love This Car	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	My 2006 Civic Ex was totaled in an accident two weeks ago. So I went to my nearest Honda dealership, where I bought my 2006, and bought a 2013. This is the third Civic I've owned and the fourth I've driven. It is such a great improvement over my 2006 Ex. The 2013 Lx has all the same features that I care about that were on my 2006 Ex. It has a very smooth, stable and quiet drive and handles easily. The rear camera is taking me a little while to get used to, but I see the necessity. The headrests on top of the front seats prevent a clear view out of the back window, especially for someone as short as I am -- 5'2-1/2". I have no problem with the braking quality.
07/11/13	Great Car	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The consumer reviews don't lie. This truly is a great car. I would suggest not getting the hybrid because the regular car on the econ mode can get 45 mpg. I use to own a VW Passat and am indescribably happy to get rid of it for my new Civic. I will never stray from Honda or Toyota ever again. The Civic is fun to drive, has a lot of nice features (pandora interface, econ mode, back up camera, ect), and is reliable. I rented a 2012 Honda Civic when I was in Boston and was really impressed with it. I ended up buying the 2013 version since it's more refined. There is a reason you see so many Honda vehicles on the road...because they make a solid car that won't leave you stranded.
06/27/13	Love my new Civic!	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Where to start this review. I must say, this car is a great value. It's quiet on the highway and in the city. So many little small features that you never expect. The i-MED screen is customizable and the headlights go off if you leave them on. Gas mileage is great. Eco mode does save you save gas while driving in the city, but at a expense of off-the-line acceleration. I love how the blinker you can tap and it does 3 blinks for you to change lanes. The headlights are great at night and the car handles great. I must say, I am still learning how to use all the features on this car. I have had it since March. I have achieved 43.7 mpg hwy on a 100 mile round trip, eco mode on. Handles GREAT!
06/12/13	Night & Day!	2013 Honda Civic EX-L w/Navigation 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I liked my daughter's 2011 EX model & decided to check-out the 2013 EXL for myself. Although her car was nice/fun to drive, this new model is significantly better in all areas. After two months, I'm more than satisfied ... Good Job Honda!
05/20/13	Honda Civic Sedan EX-L w/Nav	2013 Honda Civic EX-L w/Navigation 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Bought this car last week. Previous owner of a 2002 Honda Civic EX. Initially struggled with the thought of buying another Civic. Was hesitant until I went to dealership and sat inside, and test drove. What a difference 11 years makes! Did get all of the bells and whistles (Nav). There is no comparison between this car and my 2002 model (not that it was bad - served me well for 11 years). Drives much quieter and smoother. Highway gas mileage much nicer (41-42 mpg vs. 33 on my older unit). In town mileage about 2 mpg better (33 mpg vs 31 mpg). Decent stereo..great Nav system!
05/18/13	Fantastic Car at a Great Price	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I love this car. I never thought I'd be driving a civic, but the 2013 model is such an unbelievable value that I couldn't pass it up. I'm 46 and was looking for something safe and fuel efficient to get be to/from work. After test driving several other cars, I took the civic for a spin and was blown away by all the standard features on the base model LX, as well as the comfort, style, and price. Once I saw Honda's zero down, $230 per month for 35 months lease, it was a no brainer. I actually negotiated a better deal since my credit is very good and I was a returning customer, but I would have gone with the zero down/$230 month every day of the week. Get this car!
04/25/13	Great car can be better	2013 Honda Civic EX-L w/Navigation 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Honda did a great job on this Civic. They fixed the inadequatcies that Consumer Reports pointed out. Fit and quality excellent. For those that feel the ride noisy, upgrade to the EX. The noise is from the cheaper tires on the LX. This is true with all the Honda line up. Blue tooth works great, navi and radio excellent. Good ride quality, 36-38 MPG HW at 65-75 mph. Overall 29-31 mpg, even with my wife driving...she only know to accelerate or brake..nothing inbetween. 4 wheel disc brakes stop the car very quickly compare to disc/drum combo. I've heard some complaints about the seats, I find them very comfortable. The Hyundi elantra has 2 big blind spots, Honda does not.
04/21/13	Really glad I purchased this!	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I really enjoy this car. It's definitely saved me on gas with the econ feature. My old Elantra '01 would use up a full tank a week to get to work, with my Civic using econ I use 1/2 a tank a week. Only thing with econ is it drives a little slow going up hills and such, but that should be obvious because that's how it works. You can't hit the gas and take off, but I'm fine with that! I drove it in the horrible road conditions from our last snow storm and while it was very bumpy from the poor plowing, I may have slid once or twice, where as other cars I watched were all over the road. Some of the blind spots could take a while to adjust to.
04/20/13	Honda Civic 2013 EX-L	2013 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I've had the car for over a month now so I think I can write a fair review. I considered the Corolla, the Mazda 3, and Nissan Sentra and while I liked the colors available in all of those, I felt more comfortable driving a Civic. My old 2003 Civic was great and this is awesome! Bluetooth, spacious room for a 5'5 male. The car is just fun to drive and gives great MPG. It's quiet and climate control is great. I didn't like the wheels at first but I love the sporty look on them now. Trunk space is limited but spacious enough for groceries, sporting equipment, and the crap I carry around. Dealer wanted to sell me multiple warranties, my response.."It's a Honda!" I know it will start in the a.m.
03/12/13	Noteworthy improvements and a great daily driver	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	The compact market doesnt have 2 or 3 clear cut winners anymore. Honda underestimated this when they designed the 2012 civic (which my wife owns). For someone like her, who just wants something that is painless to own and operate, and gets good mpg, its a great car. But for me, the improvements on the 2013 are a little more than subtle. the biggest and most obvious ones are with the new standard features and the interior quality. I never had a quiet honda until now. Its quieter than my buddies 2012 focus, which is something i'd never thought id be able to say. gotten nothing but compliments and it feels very germanic..more like my old golf than my previous civics
02/13/13	Battery drain problem?	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	Love the interior and exterior quality. New civic has a comfortable ride and very good fuel efficiency. Also like the fact that bluetooth and rear view camera are standard on all 2013 Civics. However, in the second week after buying the car I didn't drive it for another week and the car wouldn't start. Turns out the battery was dead due to cold weather (around 10-20 deg F) After jump start everything was ok but for a new car this is quite unexpected. Will have to watch it going forward how it behaves....
02/12/13	Better than the 2012, but .......	2013 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I like the car overall, but I'm still having a hard time getting past the cheap honeycomb grill & the too black alloy wheels. I didn't realize when I bought the car 3 weeks ago that the radiator is as visual as the grill itself. The interior noise/engine are improved & the overall handling is very good. I wish I could get past the toys-for-us grill!
01/26/13	i would stay away from honda at least CIVIC	2013 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	i purchased a 2013 civic on december 2 2012 two weeks after i started hearing a "thunk" sound from the gasoline tank and the gasoline sloshing in the gasoline tank, the thunk is really aparent when i brake and the car stops i took it to honda and they say its normal, its a really anoying sound u can hear and feel the "thunk" the dealer FREEWAY HONDA in santa ana california no help at all,(stay away from this dealer) that means im going to have to live with that noise untill im able to trade the car in for a different brand with out taking any lo$s, the dealer doesnt even answer my emails now it seems that HONDAs quality is going down Buyer Be WARE!!!!!!!
01/23/13	Ford Focus may have the hatchback, but Civic has overall better value	2013 Honda Civic EX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I test driven the 2013's Elantra GT, Mazda CX-5, Focus SE hatchback (hb) and Civic Ex. It finally came down to the wire between the Focus and Civic.... I thought over the need of a hb, and seemed compelling at first, I don't recall needing to haul a lot of stuff last several years, and if I did I rented a van a couple of times from Home Depot. Next, the hb looks nice, but reduces the rear viewing area. Overall, I felt the Civic has improved significantly. MPG, long term cost of ownership, features and styling matters to me. The 2013 Civic nails them in pretty well. I'm giving it a 4 star on value, since it now cost a little more after Ford's recent $2,500 factory incentive.
01/14/13	uncomfortable seats	2013 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5M)	It took a few days to realize how uncomfortable the front seats are in this car. I tried to trade it back in, and was told I would take a $3k loss. They also wanted me to pay full sticker on the new car. I would not recomend Ocean Honda of New Port Richey(Florida). I chose this car for the reliability and mpg. If it wasn't for the seat, I would love this car.
12/17/12	Well Done Honda!	2013 Honda Civic EX-L w/Navigation 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl 5A)	I was looking for the most luxurious car with NAV that I could find for $25k or less. None of the other manufactures came close in features and quality. The interior quality is amazing at any cost level. The heated seats work great and the ride is very comfortable. The Bluetooth streaming works well. The steering is perfect. The acceleration is a little weak, but the MPG is great. To top off all the creature comforts, I am averaging 39.4 MPG (a lot of that is highway). I couldn't be happier. If you're looking for a sporty and fast car, look else ware. If your looking for a comfortable ride with lots of quality features at a low cost and great gas milage, this is the car!
08/04/14	Awesome Civic	2014 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT)	I purchased a 2014 Civic LX sedan with the CVT transmission in July 2014. Have owned it for about 1 month and currently have about 1000 miles on it. Love it so far! Averaging about 35 miles per gallon and getting about 400 miles to the tankful! Power is adequate for most driving conditions and the car is fun to drive. Seats are very comfortable and this car has a ton of features for the money (I paid $16,700 not including tax and license). If you're looking for a safe, reliable, economical car, this is it.
07/27/14	Was misinformed concerning gas mileage	2014 Honda Civic EX-L 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT)	April, I bought a 2014 EXL honda civic. I had a list what the car must have. Gas mileage was top on the list. I live 30 miles from town, all 75 miles hi-way. I use cruse, Econ button, and and stay in the green dash light. I have yet to see 40 mpg or even close to that mileage. The car has 3000+ miles and the Dealer said the car would get better mileage with the summer gas and once the car passed 1500 miles The car is averaging 27/33.
07/17/14	Love This Car!	2014 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT)	After seeing many family members and friends over the years owning and loving their Hondas, I decided to give in and try one on myself. I am simply amazed. A compact car that is as roomy, comfortable, and quiet as a much larger, more expensive car. Steering feels great, turns quick, soaks up the bumps, sudden braking no problem, gives the driver a feeling of confidence. Acceleration could be a little better but it's acceptable from a 4 cylinder with automatic. I've gotten 37 mpg combined city-highway. Incredible value for the money.
06/05/14	Great little Car	2014 Honda Civic LX 4dr Sedan (1.8L 4cyl CVT)	I just picked up one of these. Would have never considerd a civic but the dealer near me was having great deals on them. Boy am i glad I went to look. The 2014 Civic is smooth, large on the inside and very fuel efficent. Everything is put together very well and the car is very solid. I never lack for power and hope to have this car for many years to come.
