10/05/14	Better than the 2.5s	2012 Nissan Altima 3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT)	Not saying a whole lot but This car is not fuel efficient and expensive to drive around town. It cost 19 Gallons to fill up and you can spend a quarter tank just driving to wallmart and back! Not sure about the math but i fill up twice a week 40 Gallons a week.
06/09/14	Most dangerous vehicle on the road	2012 Nissan Altima 3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT)	I have had repeat visits to the dealer to address the problem of hesitation when accelerating, which I am told the service department cannot duplicate, and they cannot fix what they can't find. I have had my car for 26 months and hate driving it on the highways. When I travel to San Diego to visit grandchildren, I rent a vehicle. Am I the only Altima owner experiencing this problem? Now, the transmission is jerking when driving at low speeds. So, the vehicle is back at the dealer's shop once again. What a horrible Nissan product!
04/06/14	Car wont start	2012 Nissan Altima 2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT)	We leased this vehicle... Got a great deal.. But the car now wont start and has to be towed to dealer hopefully they fix it... The dealer we got the car from is very good and the service guys are very nice and helpful... NPN in nj rt 22. The car at high speed with weight in the back passengers is ver unstable. The car has a nice design and interior but over all its a cheap built... In the snow its undrivable and as good as rear wheel drive. MPG is ok but not great. Seats are very comfortable and the dash is nice. The push button start has recently failed and the car will have to be towed...
03/05/14	Very Surprised	2012 Nissan Altima 3.5 SR 4dr Sedan (3.5L 6cyl CVT)	I bought my 3.5SR wit 24,000 miles on it and I am very happy with it. I have the fully loaded edition. Drives smooth, very comfortable, the leather is great quality and it has 270 hp so it is a blast to drive. I drove 210 miles and used 1/2 of a tank. I am 6-2 and have wide shoulders but i feel small in the car because it had tons of room up front and in back. My friend is taller than me and has plenty of leg room while sitting behind me. Its a sound car with no rattles or hollow sounds. Well built. I would recommend a altima to anyone.
01/01/14	A Family sedan car for REAL	2012 Nissan Altima 2.5 S 4dr Sedan (2.5L 4cyl CVT)	We love our Altima, everybody drives it cause its give good MPG. I fillup and takes me everywhere, farther places and still last a week. I'm a truck guy so I use to seeing the fuel gauge needle move daily but on this Altima it takes awhile. When I dirve I average 28-30 mpg combine with 40 city and 60 hwy. The cabin is roomy specially the backseats. I never seen a roomy back seats car like the Altima. The trunk is massive can probably fit 2 full size adults with some space to spare. Love the suspension not noisy and handles very well. I can park easily and maneuver around corners, remember I'm a pickup truck guy so driving this car is mere child play.
